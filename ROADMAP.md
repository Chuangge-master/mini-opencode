# Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan and upcoming features for mini-OpenCode. We welcome community contributions!

## 🚀 Planned Features

### Core Capabilities
- [ ] **Agent Runtime Sandbox**: Implement a secure sandbox environment for executing agent-generated code to ensure safety and isolation.
- [ ] **Clarification Mechanism**: Enable the agent to proactively ask clarifying questions when user instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
- [ ] **Long-term Memory**: Implement persistent memory capabilities to allow the agent to recall project context, user preferences, and history across different sessions.

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Sub-Agents Visualization**: Add UI components to visualize the hierarchy and activities of sub-agents during complex task delegation.
- [ ] **Reasoning Process Display**: Support displaying the model's internal "Thinking" or "Reasoning" process (Chain-of-Thought) to improve transparency.
- [ ] **TUI Performance Optimization**: Optimize the Terminal User Interface (TUI) rendering engine to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.
